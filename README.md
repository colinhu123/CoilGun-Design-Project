# Coilgun Design and Manufacture Project

Belonging to WFLA Physics Society

## For those who cannot read code

### Coding Environment

If you have VPN, please visit site [Colab](https://colab.google/)

If you do not have VPN, please visit [Repl](repl.it) or [Paddle](https://aistudio.baidu.com/index)

These three are online coding platform for python.

If you want to install python environment, pleases go to [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [python](https://www.python.org/) to download python and VScode.


### Instruction

Python is strongly recommended in the project.

Please read `Python入门I.ipynb`,`Python入门I.ipynb`and`type_hint.ipynb`.

These two notebook are brief introduction of basic grammar of Python.


## For those who can read code

You guys may play an important role in this part of design.

The core of this design is to simulate electromagnetic environment and implementing optimization
